## Challenges
I struggled with my style sheet quite a bit, the more I work on HTML and CSS the more confident I become in writing it. 

## Victories
Victories have happened each time my code works. I really enjoyed using different color pallets and customizing the style of my portfolio.

The design aspect is proabably my favorite part of the process. I found another really cool resource for adding icons! I decided to utilize that also!
